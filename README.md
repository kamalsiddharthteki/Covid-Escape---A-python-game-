# Covid-Escape---A-python-game-
The current covid pandemic has had an impact on all of us. 
Nevertheless, depending on our situation, the pandemic's impact and its effects are perceived in different ways. 
While some people attempt to adjust to working online, homeschooling their kids, others are forced to be exposed to the virus in order to sustain in this society. 
The requirement to wear a face mask in eateries, supermarkets, as well as other public areas is one of the most notable lifestyle changes brought on us by the covid pandemic going on. 
To stop the spread of this deadly virus that affects humanity fatally, it is essential to wear a mask, particularly when we are around other individuals. 
Lot of people who were infected with covid virus donâ€™t show any of its symptoms but still has the ability to spread the virus as it is contagious and airborne. 
So, public knowledge of proper masking is very essential. This thought led us to the development of the Covid Escape Game, which is one of the ways to create awareness among the people about the importance of wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing by playing the game encountering each and every covid contaminated pipe (covid wave) without coming in contact with them in order to survive more number of covid waves.
